    <p>
        Barbie is from the movie <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_(film)">Barbie</a></cite> directed by Greta Gerwig. The movie is based on a series of Barbie dolls made by Mattel. Barbie has a great day every day and loves pink.
    </p>
    <p>The reasons I admire Barbie are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="highlight"> She loves pink. </li>
        <li> She wears Birkenstocks. </li>
        <li> She helped save Barbieland from patriarchy.  </li>
    </ul>
